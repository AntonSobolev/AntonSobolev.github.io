<span style="font-family:'JetBrains Mono';font-size: 175%;"><b>Anton Sobolev</b></span>

I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Texas at Dallas.  My research spans four interconnected fields: contentious politics, information control & beliefs manipulation, cybercrime, and cognitive disorders. Together, they form a framework for understanding the evolving logic of coercion, persuasion, and exploits in the cyberspace and beyond.

At the heart of my inquiry lies a question: <b>What is cyberspace, and how does it redefine the boundaries between information and the physical world? Can we adapt the classic ideas of Weber, Tilly, and Olson—about monopolies on coercion—to a reality where power is diffused across networks of data and algorithms?</b> These theoretical puzzles guide my exploration of how states and criminals exploit cognitive vulnerabilities information flows to enforce control in an era where distinguishing truth from fiction has become prohibitively expensive for the average person. <br> <br>

Equally, I study the mechanics of persuasion and propaganda. <b>In a world teeming with bots, trolls, and covert operations, the line between organic user behavior and state-sponsored manipulation blurs.</b> This raises profound questions about the architecture of belief systems and the fragility of democratic discourse when trust in information sources erodes.<br><br>

My research delves into the <b>parallels between human and machine learning</b>. Both, it seems, are shaped by incomplete and often biased datasets—be it the emotional scars of childhood or the skewed inputs that define artificial intelligence training sets. These vulnerabilities create fertile ground for cybercriminals  <b>to exploit cognitive weaknesses in humans and AI-based systems.</b><br><br>

Each of these threads —- cyberspace, manipulation, behavioral vulnerabilities, and the blurred boundaries between humans and machines -— connects to a broader ambition: to map the invisible contours of power and resistance in a world where the digital and the physical increasingly overlap.

I am an Assistant Professor of Political Economy and Cyber Policy at the University of Texas at Dallas. My research studies questions of politics using text analysis, machine learning, and causal inference. My recent projects focus on mass protest, cybersecurity, and political control in autocracies. More broadly, I study how digital technology shapes political behavior. 

My work has been published in [_American Political Science Review_](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055420000295), [_World Politics_](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0043887114000215), [_European Journal of Political Economy_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2019.08.003), [_Post-Soviet Affairs_](https://doi.org/10.1080/1060586X.2013.859434), [_Europe-Asia Studies_](https://doi.org/10.1080/09668136.2013.838055), and [_Problems of Post-Communism_](https://doi.org/10.2753/PPC1075-8216600203). I published in American and Russian printed and electronic media, including [_The Monkey Cage Blog_](https://themonkeycage.org/2012/03/the-complicated-views-of-pro-and-anti-putin-protestors/), the leading Russian business daily [_Vedomosti_](https://www.vedomosti.ru/authors/anton-sobolev/documents), and [_Forbes-Russia_](http://www.forbes.ru/mneniya-column/siloviki/249581-nauchilsya-li-rossiiskii-biznes-zashchishchatsya-ot-silovikov).

Prior to my appointment at Yale, I received my Ph.D. in Political Science and M.Sc. in Statistics from University of California, Los Angeles. Before coming to UCLA, I was a research fellow at the Center for the Study of Institutions and Development at Higher School of Economics in Moscow (2013-14).

Since the results of R&D investments typically emerge years after the elected incumbent leaves her office, why do incumbent politicians pursue such policies? 



My [dissertation](dissertation/) explores the information tools employed by modern non-democratic leaders to maintain political control and their citizens’ probable responses to the strategies these tools make possible. It focuses primarily on government hiring of agents to impersonate ordinary citizens and engage online and offline with members of the political opposition. 

My other current projects cover a wide range of questions associated with collective behavior in the broadest sense. In collaboration with [Keith Chen (UCLA and Uber)](http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/keith.chen/), [Zachary Steinert-Threlkeld (UCLA)](https://zacharyst.com/), and [Jungseock Joo (UCLA)](http://home.jsjoo.com/), I am developing a set of spatial deep learning models to examine the diffusion of protest in the United States after the presidential election of 2016. In a separate paper, we detail our study of the accuracy of estimates of crowd sizes generated by social media data. 

In another project co-authored with [Dmitry Dagaev (Moscow, HSE)](https://www.hse.ru/en/staff/ddagaev), [Natalia Lamberova (UCLA)](https://sites.google.com/site/natalialamberova/) and [Konstantin Sonin (Univeristy of Chicago)](https://harris.uchicago.edu/directory/konstantin-sonin), I study how communication technology has changed the architecture of social movements worldwide [(check our recent paper)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2019.08.003).

I have conducted field research in Russia, funded by Carnegie Corporation of New York, Emory University, Moscow Higher School of Economics, Indiana University, and St Petersburg University.
Before starting my PhD program at UCLA, I was a research fellow at the Center for the Study of Institutions and Development (2013-14) and a lecturer at the Department of Political Science at Higher School of Economics in Moscow (2010-13). I received *“The Best Lecturer of the Political Science Department”* Award in 2012. I also was a visiting research fellow at Russian & East European Institute at Indiana University.
