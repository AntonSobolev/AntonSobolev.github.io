  * *PPPE/PSCI 6302* Conflict in Cyberspace [Class Website](https://coursebook.utdallas.edu/search/pppe6302.501.23f)

Cyberspace is not an isolated concept. It expands beyond the conventional concepts of networks. While many of the digital security issues faced by companies and customers are highly technical, their underlying causes and systematic effects are inherently behavioral. Despite its technical specificities, cyberspace is a domain of human interactions. It makes little sense to approach cybersecurity from a narrow, purely technical perspective. Yet many courses focus on 'mechanics' of cybersecurity at the expense of behavioral and political aspects. In contrast, this class explores cyberspace as a synergistic entity. First, it examines conflicts and violence in pre-digital age. Next, it discusses orgins, organization, and evolution of cyberspace. Finally, it explores how cyberspace reshapes conventional conflicts and produces new ones.

Students get free access to **DataCamp** to prepare themselves for the coding part of this course. [Link to DataCamp for UTD students](#PendingDatacampApproval)

This course introduces students to the public policy aspects of cybersecurity. Students will apply the tools of game theory, statistics, and causal inference to inform policy decision-making. The course is divided into four parts. The first introduces the basic concepts and definitions related to policy, governance, and threats. The second part exposes students to the modern policy analysis toolkit. The third part explores the impact of cyber policies on the private sector (topics include cyberpiracy, Dark Net markets, data breaches, deplatforming, and others). The fourth part of the course focuses on the state actors (topics include electoral integrity, misinformation, digital repression, and others).

  * *PLSC-455* Big Data, AI, and Russian Politics [Class Website](https://yale.instructure.com/courses/60670)

This cross-disciplinary seminar focuses on two broad questions. First: how do politicians use new technologies to influence politics? Second: how do scholars use new technologies to study politics? It uses Russia as a laboratory to explore these questions. The course consists of four parts. It starts with a review of contemporary Russia and pays attention to the quantitative studies of its economy and politics. Next, the course provides a non-technical introduction to Big Data and AI algorithms. Finally, it outlines the applications of the new technologies to the study of Russian politics.
